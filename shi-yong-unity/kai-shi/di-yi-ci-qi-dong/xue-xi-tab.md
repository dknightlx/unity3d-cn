# The Learn tab

The**Learn**tab in the Home window gives you access to a variety of tutorials and learning resources \(including example Projects that you can import directly into Unity\) to help you get started with Unity.

The Learn tab is visible in the Home window after Unity is opened. The Home window can also be accessed from within the Editor by navigating to**File**&gt;**NewProject**  
.

The Learn tab is split into four sections:

* **Basic Tutorials**
* **Tutorial Projects**
* **Resources**
* **Links**

The**Tutorial Projects**section contains a list of tutorial Projects that you can import into Unity.

Each tutorial includes a full example Project, along with written and video guides, and all the resources you need to complete the Project yourself.

To download and import a tutorial Project into Unity, click the**Download**button to the right of the relevant Project. Unity then downloads all of the required Assets for the tutorial Project you have selected. When the download has finished, click the**Start**button to automatically create and open a new Project that contains all of the resources you need to follow the tutorial.

To access the video guides and full tutorials, click the**Read More**button to the right of the Project you want to know more about.

You can also follow a video tutorial for your chosen Project on the[Unity Learn](https://unity3d.com/learn)website.

**Resources**

section of the Learn tab

The**Resources**section contains links to[Asset Packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackages.html)

that you can use to quickly build Projects.

To download an Asset Package from the Learn tab, click the**Download**button to the right of the Asset Package you want to download. Unity then automatically downloads all of the Assets included in your chosen Asset Package.
