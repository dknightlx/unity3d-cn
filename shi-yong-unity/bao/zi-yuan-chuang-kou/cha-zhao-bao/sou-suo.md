# Search box

You can use the search box at the top of the Packages window to find any packages that match the text you enter. The Package Manager updates the package list as you enter text, displaying every package within the current scope that matches. For example, if you enter**web**in the search box, the list displays different results depending on whether you choose the**Built-in packages**  
scope or the**All packages**scope:

Search for specific text

You can look for a package by its[package name](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-manifestPkg.html#name), its[tag name](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-details.html#Tags), or its[package version number](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-list.html#VersionList). The Package Manager analyzes the text that you enter to detect which method you are using and updates the list of packages dynamically.

**Package name**

You can search for either the display name as it appears in the Packages window or the registered package name that begins with**com.unity**.

Your search text could match the beginning, middle, or end of the package’s name.

**Tag name**

To search by[tag name](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-details.html#Tags), enter one of the package version tags. For example, if you enter**verified**in the search box, only packages with a verified tag appear, regardless of their package name.

**Version number**

Enter the[version number](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-list.html#VersionList)in version order \(**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**\). For example, typing**1**returns all packages with versions beginning with**1**\(for example,**1.0.0**,**1.3.2**,**1.10.1**, and**10.0.0**all match but not**0.1.0**\).
