Set the scope of packages to list

You can select from these options:

* The**All packages**scope \(the default\) displays all packages on the[package registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-concepts.html#Registry), regardless of whether they are already installed in your Project. This also includes[local](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-localpath.html)packages \(which are always installed\).

* The**In Project**scope displays all packages currently installed in your Project, including[local](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-localpath.html)packages.

* The**Built-in packages**  
  scope displays only built-in Unity packages, which represent some of the core Unity features. You can use these packages to[turn Unity modules on and off](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-disable.html).

  **NOTE**: You can find out more about what each module implements in the[Unity Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-api.html). Each module assembly page lists which APIs the built-in package implements.

When you select a new scope, your choice appears on the package scope drop-down menu and the list displays the packages matching your choice.

**NOTE**: If you entered any text in the[search box](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-search.html), the list only displays packages which match both the scope and the search criteria.
