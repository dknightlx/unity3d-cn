# 管理你的许可证

### 如果你的机器已经不再使用:

You can return activations from the serial number\(s\) added to your webstore account.

1. Go to the
   [License Management Section](https://store.unity3d.com/account/licenses)
   of your webstore account.
2. Add your serial number to the account if it is not already added.
3. Click
   **Activations**
   to the right of the serial number.
4. Click
   **Disable all Activations**
   .

_Unfortunately you cannot return single activations, this only resets them._

### If your machine is still accessible:

You are now able to manage your license from the editor. Below is a guide to how this system works and performs.

1. Click the
   **Unity**
   drop-down on your
   **toolbar**

\(  
   **Help**  
   on Windows OS\).  
2. Click the  
   **Manage License**  
   option. \(This is the unified place within the Editor for all your licensing needs\).

The**License Management**window will appear. You then have four options, explained below:

License Management Window

| :--- | :--- |
| **Check for updates** | Cross-references the server, querying your Serial number for any changes that may have been made since you last activated. This is handy for updating your license to include new add-ons once purchased and added to your existing license via the Unity Store. |
| **Activate New License:** | Enables you to activate a new serial number on the machine you’re using. |
| **Return License** | Enables you to return the license on the machine in question, in return for a new activation that can be used on another machine. Once clicked, the Editor will close and you will be able to activate your serial number elsewhere. For more information on how many machines a single license enables use on, please see our[EULA](http://unity3d.com/company/legal/eula). |
| **Manual Activation** | Enables you to activate your copy of Unity offline. This is covered in more depth[here](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html). |

If you encounter any error codes or other problems, please refer to the[Unity Support Knowledge Base](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/sections/202242003-Activations-and-Management)or[contact Unity Customer Support](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=65905)for more assistance.
