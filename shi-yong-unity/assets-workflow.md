# Asset Workflow

These steps provide a general overview of the basic principles of working with Assets in Unity.

An Asset is a representation of any item you can use in your game or Project. An Asset may come from a file created outside of Unity, such as a 3D Model, an audio file, an image, or any of the other file types that Unity supports. There are also some Asset types that you can create in Unity, such as a ProBuilder**Mesh**  
, an**Animator Controller**  
, an Audio Mixer, or a**Render Texture**  
.
