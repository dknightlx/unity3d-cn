A swatch library is a collection of swatches that you save in a file. The Swatches section displays a single library at a time.

1. Open the Color Picker, Gradient Editor, or Curve Editor. For example, select
   **Main Camera**
   in the
   [Hierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/Hierarchy.html)
   window.
2. In the
   [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)

 

   window, click

3. In the picker window, adjust the color, gradient, or curve to your liking.

Drag and drop swatches to change their order. Right-click a swatch to move it to the top, replace it, rename it, or delete it. You can also delete a swatch by Alt/Option-clicking it.

Use the drop-down menu in**Swatches**to:

* Choose
  **List**
  or
  **Grid**
  to change the view. The List view also displays the names of swatches.
* Choose a swatch library.
* Choose
  **Create a Library**
  to create a new swatch library and the location to save it in.
* Choose
  **Reveal Current Library Location**
  to view the current library in Windows Explorer/Mac OS Finder.

By default, Unity saves swatch libraries in your user preferences. You can also save a swatch library in your Project. Unity saves Project swatch libraries in the_Editor_folder of the_Assets_folder. To share Project swatch libraries between users, or to include them in a package, add them to a revision control repository.

To edit a Project swatch library:

1. Select the swatch library in the
   [Project](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/ProjectView.html)

 

   window.
2. In the
   [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)
   window, click
   **Edit**
   .
